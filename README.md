# Language Zen Demo
Application can be run by typing:

*npm install* (to install packages needed by the app)

followed by:

*npm start*

at the command prompt in the folder containing the source code. Make sure you have Node.js installed on the machine.

## Observations

The Javascript code uses 2 white space chars for tab and leaves out trailing semicolons, thus following the standard Node.js guidlines. 

The application doesn't include "Too early" and "Too late" key presses in the user history correctness percentage, but it should be very easy to add.
